Peter's fellowship focus is Rhizomatica, establishing low-cost, low-power, open-source cellular infrastructure that can serve rural areas profitably using inexpensive handsets that many already own. His priorities include policy modelling and business model development.

We support Rhizomatica because affordable, immediate communication is one of the building blocks of progress. Peter is democratising access to telecommunication technology by localising control and decreasing cost.
